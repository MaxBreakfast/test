title: Add players to a room usign socket.io
---

My team and I have been developing a trivia game using ionic and socket.io. Since we are developing a game that will incorporate social features we decided to make it a native app. For this post I will briefly be describing how to add users to a specific 'room' (or other game state), where in they can interact with other users.

Let's take the example of joining a game in our app. When a user launches the app they ar taken to the selection room, where they can either join game lobby or create one. If the user creates a room the client will emit a 'createRoom' event wich will trigger the following socket event.

The 'updateLobbies' event lets all of the clients that are using the app know that there has been an update to the list of lobbies (in this case an addition) and provides all of the users with an updated list of lobbies. In this case socket.join creates a connection with between the user who is creating the lobby and the lobby itself. the lobby information is then passed back to the client using the callback.
